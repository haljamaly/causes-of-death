    "On the data science and machine learning platform Kaggle, the competition with the currently highest prize is for a passenger screening algorithm, awarded by the US Department of Homeland Security. Judging from the attention that the threat of terrorism is receiving in the media, these efforts meet a considerable public interest in the danger arising from terrorism. At the same time, the amount of attention that media allocates on multiple other causes of death that are more relevant by orders of magnitude seems to fall behind disproportionately. According to [businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/death-risk-statistics-terrorism-disease-accidents-2017-1), the lifetime odds of dying from foreign-born terrorism in the US are 1 in 45808. For comparison, it is approximately five times as likely to die in an airplane or spaceship incident, five and a half times as likely to die from police, almost five hundred times as likely to die from suicide, and respectively about 6500 times as likely to die from a heart disease or cancer, the two most common death causes in the US.\n",

    "Combs and Slovic (1979) compared the frequency distribution of all death causes reported by two US newspapers during a time span of six months in 1975 with the actual mortality rates of that year and people's reported estimates of death cause frequencies. They found that \"The frequency with which the two newspapers [...] reported various causes of death differed considerably from the statistical frequencies of those causes in the U.S. population. The finding that both newspapers, locate on opposite coasts of the U.S., allocated their coverage to causes of death in very similar ways suggests that the particular reporting biases observbed here may be widespread. Violent, often catastrophic causes of death such as homicides, natural disasters and accidents were overreported. Diseases were underreported. These biases in coverage corresponded closely to biases found in a previous study in which people were asked to judge the frequency of the same causes of death.\"\n",
